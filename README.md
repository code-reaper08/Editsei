## What is EDITsei
**EDITSei** is a markdown editor/previewer. It aims to be as minimal as it can be. **EDITsei** is a client-side web application, intended for casual writing. If you are planning to use **EDITsei** for a serious purpose, I insist you look into various alternatives, which come with full-fledged editing capabilities.

## Contributions
Contributions of any level are always welcomed. Please ensure that the contributions don't affect the minimalism of **EDITsei**.
